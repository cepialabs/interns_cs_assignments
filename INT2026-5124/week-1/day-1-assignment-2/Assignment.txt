Why i want to create my career in Cybersecurity

The reason why I am interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity is that I find the subject really fascinating, 
and it is something that I enjoy learning about because I am curious about how things work and then how those things can be compromised and secured from being so.

While working with security labs and tools, as well as with real-life incident scenarios, I came to realize that cybersecurity involves not just 
technical knowledge but also a mindset of staying cool and logical and taking informed decisions. I am very keen on learning about incident analysis 
and defensive security because it directly impacts system and data protection.

Security work connects with me on a deeper level because it is meaningful because it is actual work while being something in which I can continue to learn
technically while making a difference by protecting something, which is what I am interested in pursuing.
