File 1: OpenSSH (CVE-2024-6387)
Section: What the vulnerability is

"This vulnerability, professionally dubbed as 'regreSSHion,' is a critical security flaw identified as a Signal Handler Race Condition (CWE-364) within the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd).

Technically, the flaw exists in the way sshd handles the SIGALRM signal. When a client connects to an SSH server but fails to authenticate within the time limit defined by the LoginGraceTime parameter (default is 120 seconds), the server triggers an interrupt signal to terminate the connection. However, due to a coding error, this signal handler calls functions that are not 'async-signal-safe' (like syslog()).

Because of this, an attacker can carefully time their communication to interrupt the heap memory management process. By winning this 'race condition,' the attacker can manipulate the server's memory to execute their own malicious code. It is called a 'regression' because this specific code vulnerability was originally fixed in 2006 (CVE-2006-5051) but was accidentally reintroduced into the software during a later update."

File 2: Apache HTTP Server (CVE-2021-41773)
Section: What the vulnerability is

"This vulnerability is a high-impact Path Traversal and File Disclosure flaw found in the Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. The root cause of this issue lies in a failure of the path normalization logic.

In a standard web request, the server is supposed to 'clean' the URL to ensure it stays within the designated public folders. However, in this specific version, the developers implemented a new path normalization method that could be bypassed using URL-encoded characters. Specifically, attackers discovered they could use the encoded sequence .%2e or %%32%65 (which translates to a dot .) to represent ../ (parent directory).

By sending a crafted URL containing these sequences, an attacker can 'escape' the restricted web root directory. If the server configuration does not have the 'Require all denied' security rule applied to the entire file system, the attacker can successfully map URLs to files located anywhere on the server's hard drive."

File 3: MySQL Server (CVE-2023-21912)
Section: What the vulnerability is

"This vulnerability is a significant security weakness located within the Security: Privileges component of the Oracle MySQL Server. It affects both legacy (5.7) and modern (8.0) branches of the database software.

The flaw is categorized as a logic error in how the server manages internal security checks and user privilege verification during network-based interactions. Unlike many other database vulnerabilities that require an attacker to first steal a username and password, this specific flaw is unauthenticated. This means an attacker only needs network access to the MySQL port (usually 3306) to trigger the bug.

It is an 'Easily Exploitable' vulnerability because it doesn't require complex user interaction or high-level system permissions. The attacker sends a series of specially crafted protocol packets that the server's privilege component cannot handle correctly, leading to an immediate failure of the database service."
