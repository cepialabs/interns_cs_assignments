Vulnerability Assessment Report
1. Target: Metasploitable 2
System Role: Vulnerable Linux Machine for Network Security Testing. Target IP: 192.168.57.159 Tool Used: Nmap (NSE Scripts)

Critical Finding: Avahi NULL UDP packet Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE Identification: CVE-2011-1002.

Vulnerability Description: The Avahi service on this machine is susceptible to a NULL UDP packet, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) state on the target.

Security Status: The system is intentionally configured with multiple open ports (FTP, SSH, Telnet) and outdated services to facilitate penetration testing practice.

2. Target: OWASP Broken Web Apps (DVWA)
System Role: Vulnerable Web Application Environment. Target IP: 192.168.57.152 Tools Used: Nmap (http-enum, http-vuln) and Nikto.

Web Vulnerability (Critical): Apache Range Header Denial of Service.

CVE Identification: CVE-2011-3192.

Impact: This vulnerability allows an attacker to exhaust server memory and CPU resources using specifically crafted "Range" headers, potentially making the web application unavailable to legitimate users.

Information Disclosure: The http-enum scan successfully discovered sensitive directories:

/phpmyadmin/ (Database management interface).

/wordpress/ (Installation directory).

Security Misconfiguration: Directory Listing Enabled was detected in the /icons/ and /images/ folders. This allows attackers to view the file structure and identify sensitive files on the server.
