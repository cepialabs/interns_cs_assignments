Vulnerability Assessment & Research Report
Date: February 10, 2026

Tools Used: Nmap (NSE Scripts), Nikto Web Scanner

Targets: Metasploitable 2 (192.168.57.159), DVWA/OWASP BWA (192.168.57.152)

1. Assignment: Network & Web Vulnerability Scanning
A. Metasploitable 2 Results (Nmap NSE)
Vulnerability: Avahi NULL UDP packet Denial of Service.

CVE ID: CVE-2011-1002.

Finding: The service is vulnerable to a specific UDP packet that can crash the mDNS responder.

Network Status: Multiple high-risk ports like 21 (FTP), 23 (Telnet), and 512 (Rexec) are open with outdated services.

B. DVWA Results (Nikto Web Scan)
Critical Vulnerability: Apache Remote Buffer Overflow (CVE-2002-0082).

Information Leakage: * Git Exposure: Sensitive files detected at /.git/config and /.git/index. This can leak the entire source code.

Directory Indexing: Folders /dvwa/config/ and /dvwa/docs/ are publicly accessible, exposing internal server details.

Outdated Software: * Apache 2.2.14 (End of Life)

PHP 5.3.2 (Vulnerable to multiple legacy exploits)

2. Mini Task: Research & Validation
Task: Identify 3 Potential Vulnerabilities & Validate CVEs

Vulnerability Type,Findings,CVE / Validation
Network DoS,Avahi NULL UDP Packet,CVE-2011-1002: Confirmed real-world vulnerability in mDNS.
Web Server DoS,Apache Range Header,CVE-2011-3192: Validated; allows attackers to crash the server via memory exhaustion.
Remote Shell,mod_ssl Buffer Overflow,CVE-2002-0082: High-severity vulnerability in older Apache versions allowing remote command execution.

Task: Identify Web Misconfigurations (Nikto)
Security Header 1: X-Frame-Options is missing. Impact: Website is vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks.

Security Header 2: X-Content-Type-Options is not set. Impact: Browser might interpret files incorrectly (MIME sniffing), leading to XSS.

Insecure Method: HTTP TRACE is enabled. Impact: Vulnerable to Cross-Site Tracing (XST) which can steal cookies.

3. Conclusion & Recommendations
Update Services: Both targets are using End-of-Life (EOL) software (Apache 2.2, PHP 5.3). Immediate upgrade to latest stable versions is required.

Fix Headers: Add security headers (X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security) to the web server configuration.

Disable Directory Indexing: Turn off Options Indexes in Apache to hide sensitive folders like /config/.
