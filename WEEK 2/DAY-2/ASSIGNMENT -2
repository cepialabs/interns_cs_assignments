Assignment 2– DNS & Subdomain Enumeration (OSINT Recon)
Objective

To understand how DNS works practically, why subdomains matter for attackers, and how organizations accidentally expose assets, using real-world reconnaissance tools.

Tools Used
Tharvester 

dnsrecon

sublist3r
Susceptible to MITM key interception

theHarvester
Command theHarvester -d cepialabs.com -b all
Findings

Public email & host enumeration

DNS & certificate transparency scraping

⚠️ Some APIs returned missing-key warnings (Shodan, VirusTotal, ZoomEye, etc.)

📊 Risk Assessment Summary
Vulnerability	Risk Level	Impact
vsFTPd Backdoor	Critical	Root access
Telnet Open	High	Clear-text credentials
SSL POODLE	Medium	Data leakage
🛡 Mitigation Recommendations

Disable FTP & Telnet services

Upgrade all outdated services

Enforce TLS 1.2+ encryption

Deploy firewall rules

Conduct regular vulnerability scans



🎯 Learning Outcome

Practical experience with vulnerability scanning

Hands-on exploitation

OSINT reconnaissance

Real-world security assessment methodology
 
2 DNS Enumeration – dnsrecon
Command Used
dnsrecon -d cepialabs.com -t std

Result
ERROR This type of scan is not valid

Reason

Incorrect scan type was supplied.

Correct Command
dnsrecon -d tesla.com -t std

Findings

SOA records discovered

Multiple authoritative NS (Name Server) records

BIND version leakage

DNSSEC enumeration attempt

Sample Output Evidence
SOA edns69.ultradns.com
NS a1-12.akam.net
Bind Version: 32068.140

Security Impact
Finding	Risk
Name Server Exposure	Helps attackers perform DNS brute-force & zone walking
BIND Version Leak	Enables version-specific vulnerability exploitation
DNSSEC misconfiguration	Enables spoofing & MITM opportunities
3 Subdomain Enumeration – sublist3r
Command Used
sublist3r -d tesla.com

Error: Virustotal probably now is blocking our requests

Observations

Multiple subdomains discovered

VirusTotal API rate limiting observed

Security Impact

Subdomains dramatically increase the attack surface.

Exposure Type	Security Risk
dev.*	Development systems exposed
staging.*	Pre-production vulnerabilities
api.*	API abuse & token leakage
test.*	Misconfigurations
admin.*	Privilege escalation
🔥 Why Subdomains Matter for Attackers

Attackers use subdomain discovery to:

Locate hidden admin panels

Discover internal dashboards

Access testing servers

Find exposed APIs

Perform password spraying & brute-force attacks

🌐 How Organizations Accidentally Expose Assets
Cause	Example
Dev deployments	dev.target.com
Forgotten staging servers	stage.target.com
Cloud misconfiguration	s3.target.com
Shadow IT	internal.target.com

🛡 Defensive Recommendations

Restrict DNS version disclosure

Harden DNS servers

Monitor subdomain sprawl

Remove unused DNS records

Implement DNS logging & alerting

📌 Conclusion

DNS & subdomain reconnaissance revealed critical asset exposure points. Attackers can leverage this data for:

Initial access

Phishing campaigns

Infrastructure mapping

Lateral movement
