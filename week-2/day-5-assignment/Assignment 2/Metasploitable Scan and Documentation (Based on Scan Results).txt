Assignment 2: Metasploitable Scan and Documentation (Based on Scan Results)
Target Machine

IP Address: 192.168.57.159

Machine Type: Local vulnerable lab (Metasploitable)

1. Number of Open Ports

Based on the Nmap service and OS detection scans, a total of 23 TCP ports were found to be open on the target system.

These open ports include services such as FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP, SMB, databases, remote access services, and application servers.
The high number of open ports indicates a large attack surface.

2. Risky Services Observed (Based on Scan Behavior)

From the scan output, several services appear risky due to insecure protocols, old versions, or direct exposure:

FTP (Port 21 – vsftpd 2.3.4):
This version is known to be vulnerable and allows unauthenticated access in certain cases.

Telnet (Port 23):
Telnet transmits credentials in clear text, making it insecure.

Bind Shell (Port 1524):
The scan shows a bind shell running, which directly exposes a root shell and represents a critical security risk.

SMB (Ports 139 & 445 – Samba):
Older Samba versions are commonly affected by remote code execution and information disclosure issues.

rsh / rlogin Services (Ports 512 & 513):
These are legacy remote login services that do not provide encryption.

VNC (Port 5900):
Older VNC implementations often have weak or no authentication.

UnrealIRCd (Port 6667):
This service has a history of backdoored versions and is considered high risk.

3. Outdated Software Versions Identified

From the service version detection (-sV) and OS detection (-O) results, the following outdated components were identified:

vsftpd 2.3.4

Apache HTTPD 2.2.8

OpenSSH 4.7p1

MySQL 5.0.51a

PostgreSQL 8.3.x

ISC BIND 9.4.2

Linux Kernel 2.6.x

These versions are no longer supported and may contain known vulnerabilities.
