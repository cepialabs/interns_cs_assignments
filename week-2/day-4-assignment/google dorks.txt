Reconnaissance Report: OSINT & Google Dorking
Date: February 3, 2026

Objective: Identify exposed sensitive information and directories using Google Dorks.

Target Domain: .gov.pk.

1. Exposed Directories Discovery
Query Used: intitle:"index of" "parent directory" site:gov.pk.

Observation: Found an open directory at faef.gov.pk/file/books/ATM/.

Files Exposed: Thumbs.db, show_ads.js, style.css, and various image files.

Risk Analysis: Directory listing is enabled, which allows an attacker to see the internal folder structure and potentially find hidden sensitive files.

Observation: Discovered a login portal for "Federal Government Educational Institutions" at fgei.gov.pk/internship/admin/login.php.

Features: The page contains fields for Email, Password, and a Verification Code (Captcha).

Risk Analysis: Exposed admin login panels are high-value targets for brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.

3. Public Document Retrieval
Query Used: filetype:pdf site:gov.pk.

Observation: Successfully located and downloaded official government PDF documents.

Risk Analysis: Sensitive PDFs may contain internal metadata, employee names, or confidential policy details that should not be public.
