🔍 Scan Findings Summary

Multiple critical & high-risk vulnerabilities were identified during the scan.

🚨 Identified Vulnerabilities & CVE Research
1️⃣ SSL POODLE Attack Vulnerability
Field	Details
Service	SSL / TLS
Vulnerability	POODLE Attack
CVE	CVE-2014-3566
Severity	🔴 High
Impact	Sensitive data leakage via MITM
🔎 Description:

SSL 3.0 uses weak CBC padding, allowing attackers to decrypt encrypted traffic using a padding oracle attack.

📌 Risk:

Session hijacking

Credential theft

Data leakage

2️⃣ Apache HTTP Slowloris Denial of Service
Field	Details
Service	Apache HTTP
Port	80
Vulnerability	Slowloris DoS
CVE	CVE-2007-6750
Severity	🟠 High
Impact	Web server resource exhaustion
🔎 Description:

Slowloris keeps many partial HTTP connections open, exhausting server threads, leading to denial of service.

📌 Risk:

Website outage

Service disruption

3️⃣ SSL CCS Injection Vulnerability
Field	Details
Service	OpenSSL
Vulnerability	CCS Injection
CVE	CVE-2014-0224
Severity	🔴 High
Impact	Session hijacking, MITM attacks
🔎 Description:

Improper processing of ChangeCipherSpec allows attackers to downgrade encryption and hijack sessions.

📊 Risk Assessment
Risk Level	Status
Overall Risk	🔴 CRITICAL
System Impact	Complete system compromise possible
Network Risk	High lateral movement potential
🛡 Security Recommendations

Disable SSL v2 / SSL v3

Enforce TLS 1.2 / TLS 1.3

Patch Apache HTTP Server

Apply latest OpenSSL security updates

Close unnecessary open ports

Implement firewall rules & IDS

📌 Conclusion

The Metasploitable system is highly vulnerable and contains multiple critical vulnerabilities. Exploiting these weaknesses can lead to:

Remote Code Execution

Denial of Service

Man-in-the-Middle attacks

Complete system takeover

This project demonstrates real-world vulnerability assessment skills using professional tools and reporting standards.
