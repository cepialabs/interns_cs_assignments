📌 DVWA Web Server Scan using Nikto
🔎 Tool Used

Tool: Nikto v2.5.0

Target: DVWA (192.168.1.9)

Port: 80

Web Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu)

🎯 Objective

To scan DVWA using Nikto and identify:

Dangerous / Missing Security Headers

Outdated Components

Server Misconfigurations

Potentially Vulnerable Components

Interpret results instead of blindly trusting automated output

🖥️ Command Used
nikto -h http://192.168.1.9

🚨 Findings Summary

Nikto reported:

0 errors

27 findings

1 host tested

🔥 1️⃣ Dangerous / Missing Security Headers
❌ X-Frame-Options Header Missing

The anti-clickjacking header is not present.

Risk: Clickjacking attacks possible.

Impact: Attacker can embed site inside iframe.

❌ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

MIME-sniffing protection is disabled.

Risk: Browser may interpret files incorrectly.

⚠️ 2️⃣ Outdated Component (Required: 1 Vulnerable Component)
🚨 Apache 2.2.8 (Outdated)

Current 2.x branch: Apache 2.4.x

Apache 2.2.8 is very old and unsupported.

Contains multiple known CVEs.

✔ This satisfies the assignment requirement:

✅ 1 Potentially Vulnerable Component Identified

⚙️ 3️⃣ Misconfigurations Identified (Minimum 2 Required)
✅ Misconfiguration #1 – HTTP TRACE Method Enabled

TRACE method is active.

Can lead to Cross Site Tracing (XST).

Security Best Practice: Disable TRACE.

✅ Misconfiguration #2 – Directory Indexing Enabled

Found:

/doc/

/test/

/icons/

Risk:

Attackers can view internal files.

Information disclosure.

✅ Misconfiguration #3 – phpMyAdmin Exposed

/phpMyAdmin/ directory accessible.

phpMyAdmin changelog and README exposed.

Should be restricted to localhost or admin IP.

✅ Misconfiguration #4 – phpinfo.php Accessible

Reveals:

PHP version

System paths

Loaded modules

This is sensitive information leakage.

🧠 Interpretation of Results (Important Section)

Not all Nikto findings are direct vulnerabilities.

Example:

"Web server returns junk HTTP methods" → May cause false positives.

"TRACE enabled" → Only exploitable under certain conditions.

Directory indexing → Depends on exposed file sensitivity.

✔ Automated tools show possible risks.
✔ Manual verification is required before reporting as confirmed vulnerability.
