Why Prioritization Is More Important Than Volume

In cybersecurity, many vulnerabilities are found every day. It is not possible to fix all vulnerabilities at once.

Some vulnerabilities are very dangerous, while others are less harmful.

So, prioritization is important because:

It helps fix high-risk vulnerabilities first

Saves time and resources

Prevents serious attacks like hacking and data theft

Fixing the most dangerous vulnerabilities first gives better security than fixing many small issues.
