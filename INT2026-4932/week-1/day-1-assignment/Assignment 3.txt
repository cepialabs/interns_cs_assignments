Cybersecurity labs must be isolated because practicing hacking and security testing on real systems is illegal and dangerous. In an isolated lab, students and professionals can test attacks, malware, and tools without harming real people, companies, or data. If a mistake happens, only the lab system is affected, not the real world. Isolation also allows learners to freely experiment, fail, and try again without fear of legal trouble or data loss. By using virtual machines and special practice platforms, cybersecurity training becomes safe, legal, and controlled, which is why isolation is mandatory.
