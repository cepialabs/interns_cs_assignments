# Tool User vs Skill Builder – DVWA SQL Injection

## What I understood without tools (Skill Builder)
- The application directly trusts user input.
- No input validation or sanitization is applied.
- SQL query is constructed dynamically using user input.
- Logical conditions like OR can manipulate query behavior.

## What the tool made faster (Tool User)
- DevTools showed request structure instantly.
- Network tab helped confirm how parameters are passed.
- Tools reduced guesswork but did not create understanding.

## Learning
Understanding how SQL works is more important than blindly using tools.
Tools accelerate testing, but logic and analysis find the vulnerability.
