A cybersecurity lab is a controlled environment for testing malware, attacks, and vulnerabilities in 
a safe manner. Isolation is key in these scenarios to avoid accidental destruction and for security reasons.

1. Avoid Infection of the Primary Network
- Cybersecurity labs are usually involved in operation with malware, exploits, or vulnerable systems.
- This can lead to malware spreading onto other machines, if hooked into your true network.
- Isolation ensures that attacks remain confined to the laboratory.

2. Avoid interference with production systems
- Labs simulate attacks or penetration tests that can crash the servers or their software.
- These tests can disrupt real business systems if not separated, causing down times or losses of data.

3. Safe Experimentation
- Tests of various tools, scripts, or configurations by students and professionals alike can be done without risk.
- Isolation allows the testing of hazardous exploits in safety.

4. Comply with Regulations and Law
- Some labs handle sensitive data or the simulation of attacks on systems.
- Isolation ensures that experiments cannot accidentally affect other users, or violate legal rules.

5. Correct Results
- Isolation helps ensure that everything in the lab is well under control and predictable, 
which is a very important consideration during lab work involving vulnerabilities or newly proposed security solutions.
- As for connected networks, there may be noise or sudden variables.

6. Virtualization Technology Adoption
- Labs for cybersecurity may employ the use of virtual machines/virtual sandboxes.
- In this manner, if it gets compromised, it wouldn’t have any effect upon the host OS or network.
