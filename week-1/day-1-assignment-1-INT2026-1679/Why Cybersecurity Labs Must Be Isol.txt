 Why Cybersecurity Labs Must Be Isolated

Cybersecurity labs must be isolated to protect real systems and networks from accidental damage.  
Testing malware or attacks on live environments can cause data loss and legal issues.

Isolation ensures:
- Safe malware analysis  
- No impact on production network  
- Legal and ethical compliance  
- Protection from lateral movement  
- Secure learning environment

Virtual machines and sandboxing help maintain this isolation effectively.
