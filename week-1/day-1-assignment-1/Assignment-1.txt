1. What cybersecurity professionals actually do: Red Team, Blue Team, Purple Team

- Red Team: Simulate attacks to test system defenses to find and reveal any vulnerabilities.
- Blue Team: The blue team monitors, detects, and responds to attacks in order to maintain the security of the systems.
- Purple Team: Connects Red and Blue teams. Enhances collaboration and thereby security posture.
- The work for cybersecurity professionals includes monitoring, incident response, risk assessment, and security strategy.

2. White hat hacking versus black hat hacking

- Ethical Hacking: Authorized system testing to identify possible vulnerabilities; executed within the law and bounds of responsibility.
- Illegal Hacking: Access to systems or data without authorization, punishable under law.
- Ethical hackers do play a very critical role: following rules, keeping findings documented, and helping improve security.

3. Responsible disclosure

- Disclosing Process: The process of reporting the discovered vulnerabilities to the affected organization safely.
- Ensures that vulnerabilities are fixed before being exposed in public.
- Safeguards users and institutions alike, with great ethics.

4. Why isolated labs are necessary

- Offers a safe practice area in hacking as well as security testing.
- Preventing damage to live systems and networks.
- Allows learning and experimentation without any risk of legal or operation-related consequences.

5. Basics of Virtualization (Host OS vs Guest OS)

- Host OS: This is the main operating system that runs on the physical machine.
- Guest OS: The OS that is being executed within the VM atop the host OS.
- Virtualization enables several isolated environments on the same computer that can be useful for labs and testing.

6. Overview of Kali Linux Ecosystem

- Debian-based Linux distro for penetration testing & ethical hacking purposes.
- Comes with pre-installed tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Wiresh
- Provides for safe lab practice for security testing and learning techniques.
- Often used in Red Team testing as well as by information security professionals.
