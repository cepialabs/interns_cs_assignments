# Target Scope

## Overview
This document outlines the scope and boundaries of the reconnaissance and attack surface analysis that has been carried out as part of the internship task. The analysis is based on the identification of publicly available services, configurations, and information related to the target using ethical and non-intrusive methods.

## Target Details
- **Target Type:** Public-facing Web-Application
- **Target IP Address:** 137.74.187.104
- **Target Domain Name:** hackthissite.org
- **Assessment Purpose:** Internship Task
- **Assessment Type:** Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Analysis
- **Testing Methodology:** Passive and Limited Active Reconnaissance

## In-Scope Assets
The following assets and activities were considered in the scope of this assessment:
- Network-level reconnaissance of the target IP address
- Identification of open ports and services
- Service and version detection using safe scanning techniques
- Publicly accessible web services over HTTP and HTTPS
- Subdomain discovery using passive reconnaissance techniques
- OSINT-based information gathering related to the domain
## Out-of-Scope Assets
The following activities were specifically excluded from the assessment:
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks
- Password brute-force or credential-based attacks
- Exploitation attempts that could potentially disrupt services
- Social engineering or phishing attacks
- Internal network or authenticated testing

## Rules of Engagement
- Only publicly available and accessible information was analyzed
- No destructive, intrusive, or unauthorized exploitation was done
- All activities were done solely for educational and internship purposes
- Ethical hacking guidelines and responsible disclosure were followed

## Limitations
- Results are exclusively based on visible assets
- No authenticated access was used during the test
- There could be vulnerabilities or misconfigurations inside the network that are not covered in this analysis.
