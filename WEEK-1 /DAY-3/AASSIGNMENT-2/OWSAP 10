Lab Procedure: OWASP Juice Shop Setup on Kali Linux
This laboratory environment utilizes Kali Linux 2025.3 running on a VirtualBox VM to host and interact with the OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately insecure web application for security training.

1. Environment Verification
Before starting, verify the host and network environment:

Operating System: Kali Linux 2025.3 (virtualized via Oracle VirtualBox).

Network: The application is hosted locally at http://localhost:3000.

Access: Verified via Firefox browser.

2. Implementation Steps and Commands
To achieve the setup shown in the image, the following commands are typically executed in the Kali terminal.

A. Install Dependencies (Node.js)
Juice Shop is a Node.js application. Ensure the runtime is installed:

Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
B. Clone and Initialize the Repository
The source code is retrieved from the official OWASP GitHub repository:

Bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd juice-shop

# Install application dependencies
npm install
C. Launching the Application
Once dependencies are installed, start the server:

Bash

# Start the application
npm start
Note: The server will initialize and begin listening on port 3000 by default.

3. Accessing the Application
Open the Firefox browser within Kali Linux.

Navigate to the URL: http://localhost:3000/#/.

Confirm the OWASP Juice Shop header and "All Products" dashboard are visible.

4. Technical Observations from the Environment
Virtualization: The user is running kali-linux-2025.3-virtualbox-amd64.

Endpoint: The URL http://localhost:3000/#/ indicates the application is using client-side routing (Angular).

Browser Configuration: The browser has security bookmarks pre-configured, including OffSec, Exploit-DB, and Google Hacking DB.
