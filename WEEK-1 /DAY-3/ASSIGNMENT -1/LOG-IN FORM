1. Environment Setup
Browser: Google Chrome / Chromium-based browser.

Tools: Chrome Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).

Device Emulation: Responsive Mode (set to 400 x 464) to simulate mobile user-agent behavior and UI responsiveness.

2. Step-by-Step Methodology
Phase A: Network Traffic Monitoring
Open Network Tab: Navigate to the Network tab in DevTools.

Configuration: * Enable Preserve Log to ensure data isn't lost during page redirects.

Set throttling to No Throttling (or "Fast 3G" if testing for latency).

Capture: Refresh the page to capture the initial waterfall of requests.

Filter & Inspect: * Filter by Fetch/XHR to isolate API calls from static assets (CSS/JS).

Click on a specific request (e.g., POST or collect) to inspect Headers, Payload, and Response tabs.

Identify Status Codes (e.g., 200 OK, 204 No Content, 302 Redirect).
