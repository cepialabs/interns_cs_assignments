 Step-by-Step Methodology
Phase A: Network Traffic Monitoring
Open Network Tab: Navigate to the Network tab in DevTools.

Configuration: * Enable Preserve Log to ensure data isn't lost during page redirects.

Set throttling to No Throttling (or "Fast 3G" if testing for latency).

Capture: Refresh the page to capture the initial waterfall of requests.

Filter & Inspect: * Filter by Fetch/XHR to isolate API calls from static assets (CSS/JS).

Click on a specific request (e.g., POST or collect) to inspect Headers, Payload, and Response tabs.

Identify Status Codes (e.g., 200 OK, 204 No Content, 302 Redirect).

Phase B: Console & Error Diagnosis
Open Console Tab: Switch to the Console tab to view client-side logs.

Filter Levels: Ensure Errors and Warnings are selected in the filter dropdown.

Code Traceability: Click the source link (e.g., tattoo-submission-form:1) to jump to the exact line of code in the Sources tab where the error originated.

Log Analysis: Document specific failures, such as Error retrieving a token, which indicates a breakdown in session management or API authentication.
